# HonoursProject
Repo for my honours project. 

The focus is on how AI is made and used in games and the project is a godot game which is a top down wave based shooter. It has two modes:
  1.  Individual based AI, where each enemy decides on their own goals by themselves and has their own needs and wants.
  2. Squad based AI, where the enemies can join squads of enemies on the fly and the squad then decides on what the group of enemies should do.
