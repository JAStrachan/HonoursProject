<p>Repo for my honours project.</p>
<p>The focus is on how AI is made and used in games and the project is a Godot game which is a top down wave based shooter. It has two modes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individual based AI, where each enemy decides on their own goals by themselves and has their own needs and wants.</li>
<li>Squad based AI, where the enemies can join squads of enemies on the fly and the squad then decides on what the group of enemies should do.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="instructions-to-modify-and-adapt-the-code">Instructions to Modify and Adapt the Code</h2>
<p>You should first install the Godot Engine. This is a free open source engine with a very small footprint. The pen drives supplied have a copy of Godot 3.1 the most recent stable build at this time (29/04/2019). Once the engine is opened you can &quot;Import&quot; the project. Choose the file within this folder called &quot;project.godot&quot; and it will open up the project for you. Allowing you to adjust scenes and look at scripts in the context of the game.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with Godot the official docs do a wonderful job of explaining it <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/index.html">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/index.html</a>. A quick tutorial though is you can play the game within the editor by pressing the full face arrow at the top right of the editor to play the game from the starting scene. The arrow inside the the film clapper board takes you to play the scene. Most scenes created can't be played on there own as they have references to other nodes needed in the main maps. The Map scene and the SquadMap scene are the individual and the squad mode scenes respectively.</p>
